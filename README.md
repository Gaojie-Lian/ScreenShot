# ScreenShot Function.
# Maybe you can create another Button like View Online Button to interact with the screenshot function.
#In the testing phase, I put this code in UI>ChromosomeParentControl and tested it to make sure that I can achieve the effect I want. #I believe you can arrange it to a better position.
#I am running this on a Windows system. In theory it can run on a Mac, but I'm not sure. So if there are any problems or areas that I #need to improve, please let me know, thank you.
#PS: I am now trying to combine the PNG image of the screenshot with the table on the website called by the ViewOnline function. But #I am not sure if it can be achieved. So please don't expect me too much :(
